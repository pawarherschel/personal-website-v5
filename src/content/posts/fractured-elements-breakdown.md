In the previous post,
I shared my experience attending Coventry University's Summer School
and provided a week-by-week breakdown of the program. 
As a culmination of all our efforts, we participated in a game jam during the final week,
which was an exciting and intense experience. 
Together with Shashank Bhave, we created a 2D platformer titled Fractured Elements. 
The game focused on a unique mechanic where the player character constantly switches between forms,
each with different abilities,
adding an extra layer of challenge to the platforming and combat.

In this blog post, I will dive into the technical aspects of how we built Fractured Elements.
I'll discuss the game's mechanics,
how we implemented the core theme of "Continuous Change," and the challenges we faced during development.
Shashank will also be sharing his insights on level design later.
