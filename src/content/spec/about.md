# About me

Hi, I'm Herschel Pravin Pawar, you can call me kat (with a small k)!
Iâ€™ve been programming on and off since 2018,
and I wrote my first lines of rust in August 2023.
I love learning and trying new things,
and I especially love solving programs I encounter using rust.

# Why do I write?

I initially started writing
because I wanted to put out my experiences out in the internet.
"I have opinions, and I must voice them".
Simple as that.

# The reason I keep writing

I noticed that my communication skills are terrible.
I can't explain concepts in a way that general masses can understand.
My friends used
to come to me to ask about concepts they didn't understand.
But, usually, they'd go through my other friend.
I was able to explain concepts to him,
and then he would help out others.

People need to know me for a while,
before they can understand what I'm trying to teach,
and I need to know them for a while,
so I can adjust to the way they learn.

I'm out of college now,
and I can't rely on others to understand me.
So, I started writing more and more.
I'm actively trying to find more topics to write about,
and I'm open to criticism (but pls be soft >.>).

I also think that even if I can't explain the concepts 
(like in [Fractured Elements Breakdown](/posts/fractured-elements-breakdown/))
it's better to just leave it in whatever state it's in, 
instead of trying to perfect it,
and just publish it.
It's better to mark it as "complete" and then move on.

Over time, I've started to recognize hints from my brain when 
I need to explain something better.
My hope is that by practicing writing,
I'll be able to explain (and communicate) better.

I have terrible memory,
so I started microblog on Bluesky.
The first blog post that was recorded on Bluesky via microblogging is
[Hyper-V shenanigans with `nixos-generators`](/posts/hyperv-shenanigans/).

A side effect of blogging is
that I can offload the task of "remembering"
to the computer.
I'm a big proponent of letting the computer do what it's best at;
that is, remembering, and calculations.

# Goals for 2025 in no specific order

- [ ] Learn Blender (2025-05-05)
  - In progress
  - I play VRChat, and I want to express myself better in it.
- [ ] Write at least once every month (2025-05-05)
  - Ongoing
  - Get better than communication
  - [Hyper-V shenanigans with `nixos-generators`](/posts/hyperv-shenanigans/) (2025-04-25)
  - [How Jujutsu VCS helps lowers the barrier to perfect git history](/posts/jj-my-beloved/) (2025-05-??)
- [ ] GitHub contributions (2024)
  - Shows teamwork (I hope)
- [ ] Give one technical talk (2025-05-05)
  - [Kate Compton](https://www.galaxykate.com/) inspired me
    to pursue programming, 
    and now I want to pass the inspiration to others.
- [ ] More NixOS stuff (2025-05-05)
  - I've barely scratched the surface of what's possible with NixOS, 
    and Nix in general, and I can still see the benefits of it's way.
- [ ] Learn more about parallel processing (2025-05-05)
  - I believe that the future of performant code is accelerator cards,
    even if I might learn the legacy system, 
    it's still better to know about it.
    I want to use it today,
    so, I'll work with what's available today.
- [ ] Write a scientific paper and publish it in a recognized journal (2023)
  - on hold

# Why Rust

People advertise Rust because (so far)
it's the only language that's memory safe,
doesn't have a garbage collector,
and has performance comparable to C,
and the industry adoption for Rust is increasing.
The fact that I don't need to worry about memory safety,
and performance is great.
But, for me, those aren't the only reasons.

Rust reduces the cognitive load for me.
It has great tooling.
The community is inclusive and welcoming.
It takes the best parts of functional programming,
and brings it to the masses.

Coming from Python, 
the biggest upgrade for me wasn't the speed.

**It was predictability.**

There are no exceptions, or ambiguous null objects.
`Result<T, E>`, and `Option<T>` makes it explicit.
Rust also has better defaults.
But what does that matter?
Usually, the easy way is the better way.
If the borrow checker is making something hard,
then it probably means that the way I structured the program is bad.

**We stand on the shoulders of giants.**\
And we should take advantage of that.
Let the computer do what it's best at, 
and use the limited time and resources we have to fill in the rest. 

# My hubris

I want to leave a long-lasting impact on the world, 
so even once I die, 
people will still remember me.

Part of my life-long goals is to be known for public speaking.

For that, I need to get better in my field first.

I always had game development in the back of my head as my field.
But I didn't want to get into it due to the horror stories.

So I tried to find some other field,
even if it's not something as glorious or impactful as game development.

## An incomplete story of my attempts

### Java Era

did java in school
got inspired by the coding train
saw the talk by galaxykate
saw proper java code and gave up

### RedHat Era

I tried to get into system administration first.
I attempted `RHCSA` and `RHCE`, 
and failed both of them due to various circumstances.
However, I believe that I can pass them now.
Typically, you'd get two chances at the exams.
I was only able to give the exam once.
See, I studied for the exams with another person.
As an attempt at being friendly,
I tried to coordinate the exam dates and place.
One thing lead to another, 
and in the end, 
I gave the exam at the last possible dates.\
**I know better now.**

### Checking out Godot

did some quick games
something sparked
realized gamedev industry is bad
started watching game dev videos
Acerola hit
something sparkled again but decided to ignore it
saw python syntax is similar
kept hearing python is easy
decide to get into python instead


### Python Era

tried python
got fed up with python
said fuck it we ball
kept hearing about rust
then learnt rust because of propaganda from THAT channel

### Rust Era

learnt rust
converted the project from python to rust
fell in love with rust
friend kept teasing me that "i know everybody in vrc"
decided to start a vrcx-insights
will help with my terrible memory
found out decent results with simple metrics
wanted to turn it into a proper paper
academics took priority
decided to put it on hold
get intrigued by Vulkan
acerola uploads video about how to get into graphics
ask Luna if i can start with vulkan directly
she said yes


### Covuni

went to covuni
talked to professors
talked to people IN games industry
they told its not that bad
learnt the basics of unity from professors
realized how much better learning is 
when someone is interested in teaching and knows their shit
they had a course on game engine development
wanted to apply but then realize low marks
due to burnout and depression
give up on covuni (dont want to get in TERFLand)

### college ended

uncertain about what to do
def dont want to stay in india tho due to politics
two paths

1. job > get xp > get out
2. uni

kept looking for rust jobs while saying 
"if i get uni first then uni, otherwise job"
didnt do a good job on either
met a certain somebody
got me out of my paralysis
decide to full focus on game dev

### aalto

saw they dont care about marks for game dev
they care about passion
think "i am passionate"
its not game engine dev but i can learn game dev
and meet other other people
uni isnt just about studies
finland is a pleasant country
decide to go for it
tried my best to get admission
had fun with friends with the tasks
fumbled the interview HARD
made me realize how bad i am at everything
knew id get rejected
focus on improvement

### Now

trying my best to improve everything

# Life lessons I've learnt

- Never back down on learning anything new
  - everything is connected, and everything is related
  - even lessons from abstract maths like category theory will come around to be useful 
- Don't dwell in past
  - I did the best I can in the circumstances I was in
  - look forward to the future and ask myself "what can I learn to improve on that mistake"
  - you cant change the past, but you can affect the future
- Trust. your. gut.
  - Rust? good
  - Game dev? not accurate
    - Game engine development? yes please
  - If something feels wrong, question it
- Don't wait for other people
  - If I need to get something done, then I should just do it
